Current functions/process:
Checks if artist searched by user already has setlists in db, fetches if not
Calls ArtistService and SetlistFMFetchService to handle API and DB coordination
Calculates statistics to present to user, currently includes methods to return:
-Top Encore Songs
-Rarest songs
Controls data flow between the app's controllers and repositories
